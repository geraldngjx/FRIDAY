       "'\\n    Question: What is the difference between a host and a guest?\\n\\n    Context: 70mai A500S\\n1. Confirmation of appointment\\nYes, we do require a non-refundable deposit of $50 to confirm your on-site installation\\nappointment.\\n2. Duration for installation\\nOn average our installations will take around 1 hour or so.\\n4. Part Use for Dashcam\\n- Dashcam installation got use cigarette socket?\\nNo, we connect direct to fuse box or external battery pack.\\n- Wirings\\n- Dashboard and headliners will need to be removed?\\nOur installers will remove any panels that are required for a safe and secure installation.\\n-\\nReuse of own items\\n-\\nSD cards, Yes, can be tested on the spot and top up if needed.\\n-\\nHardware kit, No. All cables will be replaced, it is not recommended to use existing\\ncamera too.\\n-\\nUsually front & rear camera works together (front is the head*)\\n-\\nMix and match camera model; eg. front 70mai, rear IROAD. NO, cannot.\\n2.\\nWhat’s the difference between A500S and A800S?\\nThe main difference between the A800S & A500S would be the recording resolution, the A500S\\nrecords up to 2.7K resolution, while the A800S records up to 4K. Screen size on A500S is 2 inch,\\nwhile screen size on A800S is 3 inch.\\n3. What’s the difference between A500S and A400?\\nA500s has a higher resolution for front camera, option for timelapse recording, build in GPS compare\\nto A400\\nPro plus is A500s. Global edition is for international use, with English menu & updateable firmware\\nWhat is the hardware kit for? (70mai)\\nFor 70mai cameras, the hardware kit allows the camera to enter parking surveillance mode.\\nIn parking surveillance mode, camera will record upon impact/collision.\\nFor A500S/A800S/M300\\nThe latest update has timelapse recording as well. You can turn it on for continuous recording\\ntoo.\\n3.\\nFor parking surveillance mode, can it also detect motion instead of just upon impact or\\ncollision?\\nUnfortunately, 70mai cameras do not have these features (motion detection) at the moment. However\\ndo look out for firmware updates in the future if they were to implement motion detection as well.\\n70mai camera doesn’t have motion detection, camera will not trigger to record motion.\\n4.\\nWhat is build in GPS for (A500S / 800S / DDPAI)?\\nTo see where the footage was taken and route tracking from the footage playback.\\n5.\\nDashcam can view on phone?\\nYes, there’s mobile app so you can view footages via your phone in live view.\\n6.\\nAuto-overwrite of recordings?\\nYes. There is a loop recording for dashcams, it would automatically clear older files to make space for\\nnew.\\nIn the event of any incident files:\\n-\\n70mai event recording is locked and won’t get overwritten\\n7.\\nRecord Time (Max. 128GB SDcard)\\nRecording time for 70mai A500s with 64GB SD card is 5 hours and with 128GB SD card is\\n10 hours\\n1. Is our cameras all clear enough to see carplate?\\nYes.\\n2. Default password?\\n70mai: check through the camera system setting as every device has a different password. Go to\\nsettings under wifi settings, it will show on the display screen the wifi SSID and password.\\n1.\\nIs battery pack required or can do without?\\nIf the customer is driving continental vehicle,\\nContinental vehicle’s have slightly more sensitive electronics, without a battery pack, a\\nvoltage discharge warning may occur after the vehicle is parked for some time.\\nHowever this doesn’t do any harm to the vehicle as well as the dashcam has a voltage\\ndischarge function to cut off power to the camera as well. Installing an additional battery\\nwould help protect your vehicle’s battery in the long run as well.\\nIf the customer is driving non-continental vehicle,\\nInstalling an additional battery is not compulsory, however if you wish to further protect your\\nvehicle’s battery it is recommended to install an additional battery pack as well.\\n2.\\nWill it drain the battery in parking surveillance mode?\\nNo need to switch off. The camera will auto cut off upon hitting a certain voltage. So it will not deplete\\nyour cars battery.\\n-\\n70mai\\nWith the Hardware Kit, it will automatically cut off power to the camera when the vehicle’s\\nbattery reaches 11.4v, hence it wouldn’t drain the vehicle’s battery too.\\n3.\\nHow long can the battery pack last in parking mode?\\nEVID B100 - 20 hours on a full charge\\nEVID B200 - about 45 hours on a full charge\\n●\\ndepending on the condition of your vehicle’s battery and if it’s able to hold its charge and its\\nalso depends on the capacity of the vehicle’s battery\\n●\\nTo troubleshoot your 70MAI camera\\n1.Turn off your car engine.\\n2. Remove both the cables connecting to the camera.\\n3. Remove the SD card from the camera.\\n4. Press and hold the power button to power off the camera,(if the camera turns on instead of\\npower off, repeat the step again to power off the camera)\\n5. Reinsert the SD card in to the camera.\\n6. Reinsert the cables (short one first then the long one)\\n7. Start your car.\\n\\n\\n    Answer:\\n    '"
